Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies
The operations insert, find, update involves iterating over a list of users, in the worst case, they may take up to N iterations to return a result, where N is the 
total 
number of users. list_all however, simply returns the existing internal list of users.

Thus, the time complexities of the various operations are:

1. Insert: O(N)
2. Find: O(N)
3. Update: O(N)
4. List: O(1)

It's called a tree because it vaguely like an inverted tree trunk with branches.

The word "binary" indicates that each "node" in the tree can have at most 2 children (left or right).
Nodes can have 0, 1 or 2 children. Nodes that do not have any children are sometimes also called "leaves".
The single node at the top is called the "root" node, and it typically where operations like search, insertion etc. begin.

#Treemap
A treemap provides a stratified view of data and makes it easy to blot the patterns. The tree branches are characterized by rectangles and each of the sub_branches is 
shown in a smaller rectangle.

Parameters:

1. data_frame: This argument needs to be passed for column names (and not keyword names) to be used. Array-like and dict are transformed internally to a pandas 
DataFrame.

2. names: Either a name of a column in data_frame, or a pandas Series or array_like object. Values from this column or array_like are used as labels for sectors.

3. values: Either a name of a column in data_frame, or a pandas Series or array_like object. Values from this column or array_like are used to set values associated to 
sectors.

4. path: Either names of columns in data_frame, or pandas Series, or array_like objects List of columns names or columns of a rectangular dataframe defining the 
hierarchy of sectors, from root to leaves. 

5. color: Either a name of a column in data_frame, or a pandas Series or array_like object. Values from this column or array_like are used to assign color to marks.

# Self-Balancing Binary Trees and AVL Trees
An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one. This difference is known as
a balance factor. In the AVL tree, the values of balance factor could be either -1, 0 or 1.

# Time Complexity in Binary Search Tree

If the binary search tree is almost a balanced tree then all the operations will have a time complexity of O(logn) because the search is divided either to the left or 
the right subtree.
If the binary search tree is either left or right-skewed, then all the operations will have the time complexity of O(n) because we need to traverse till the n elements.
