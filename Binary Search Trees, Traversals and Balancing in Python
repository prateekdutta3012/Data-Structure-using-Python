Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies
The operations insert, find, update involves iterating over a list of users, in the worst case, they may take up to N iterations to return a result, where N is the total 
number of users. list_all however, simply returns the existing internal list of users.

Thus, the time complexities of the various operations are:

1. Insert: O(N)
2. Find: O(N)
3. Update: O(N)
4. List: O(1)

It's called a tree because it vaguely like an inverted tree trunk with branches.

The word "binary" indicates that each "node" in the tree can have at most 2 children (left or right).
Nodes can have 0, 1 or 2 children. Nodes that do not have any children are sometimes also called "leaves".
The single node at the top is called the "root" node, and it typically where operations like search, insertion etc. begin.

#Treemap
A treemap provides a stratified view of data and makes it easy to blot the patterns. The tree branches are characterized by rectangles and each of the sub_branches is 
shown in a smaller rectangle.
