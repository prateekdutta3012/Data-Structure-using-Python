Here's a systematic strategy we'll apply for solving problems:

1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.

2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.

3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English.

4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.

5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.

6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.

Here are some scenarios we may want to test out:
Some lists of numbers in random order.

-> A list that's already sorted.
-> A list that's sorted in descending order.
-> A list containing repeating elements.
-> An empty list.
-> A list containing just one element.
-> A list containing one element repeated many times.
-> A really long list.

Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies
The core operations in bubble sort are "compare" and "swap". To analyze the time complexity, we can simply count the total number of comparisons being made, since the 
total number of swaps will be less than or equal to the total number of comparisons (can you see why?).

for _ in range(len(nums) - 1):
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        if nums[i] > nums[i+1]:
            nums[i], nums[i+1] = nums[i+1], nums[i]
There are two loops, each of length n-1, where n is the number of elements in nums. So the total number of comparisons is 
(n−1)∗(n−1) i.e.(n−1)2 i.e.n^2−2n+1

Expressing this in the Big O notation, we can conclude that the time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2) (also known as quadratic complexity).

To performing sorting more efficiently, we'll apply a strategy called Divide and Conquer, which has the following general steps:
-> Divide the inputs into two roughly equal parts.
-> Recursively solve the problem individually for each of the two parts.
-> Combine the results to solve the problem for the original inputs.
-> Include terminating conditions for small or indivisible inputs.
